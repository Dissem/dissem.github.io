I just discovered Jekyll and thought I'd give it a try. It seems easy to use and is well integrated into GitHub. I'll try to keep you up and running about my projects, most notably my efforts to bring Bitmessage to the Java (and Android) platform.

I plan to create project site and add some very nice documentation once I get the hang of Jekyll, but for now you can get your information from the project pages for [Jabit][jabit] and [Abit][abit].
