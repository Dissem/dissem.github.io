title: Jabit with NIO - almost there
---
There are still some weird bugs, but a mostly functioning test was very promising. Unfortunately, fixing that "one last bug" caused an other one, more difficult bug.

Whenever I'm stuck with my work on Jabit, it's good news for the app - I updated it to use the latest development snapshot version of Jabit and finally designed a proper icon. Apparently one of those solved a few issues.

As soon as the nio thing is done, I'll release new versions of both Jabit and Abit. It will break a few minor things, so this will probably be version 2.0. [Semver](http://semver.org/) makes for some pretentious version numbers.
